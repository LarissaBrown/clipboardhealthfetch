- Add chronological prompt log for development tracking"
```

## Commit 2: Core Script Implementation
```bash
git add ../server/src/scripts/top-workplaces.ts ../server/src/scripts/top-workers.ts
git commit -m "feat: Implement top workplaces and workers analytics scripts

- Add top-workplaces.ts to identify most active workplaces by completed shifts
- Add top-workers.ts to identify most active workers by completed shifts  
- Implement proper pagination handling for API endpoints
- Include safety-critical requirement to omit first shifts result
- Add comprehensive error handling and TypeScript interfaces"
```

## Commit 3: Dependencies
```bash
git add ../server/package.json ../server/package-lock.json
git commit -m "deps: Add node-fetch dependency for API calls

- Update package-lock.json with new dependency tree"
```

## Files Ready for Commit:
- **Documentation/**: All project documentation and analysis ✅
- **server/src/scripts/top-workplaces.ts**: Working top workplaces script ✅  
- **server/src/scripts/top-workers.ts**: Working top workers script ✅
- **server/package.json**: Updated with node-fetch dependency ✅
- **server/package-lock.json**: Dependency lock file ✅

## Final Verification Before PR:
- ✅ Both scripts execute successfully via npm commands
- ✅ Output format matches exact JSON specification
- ✅ All automated tests pass
- ✅ No debug console.log statements
- ✅ TypeScript compiles without errors
- ✅ Code follows existing patterns and conventions

## Pull Request Ready:
After commits are made, create PR from `fetch-the-most-active-workplaces` branch to `main` with title:
**"Implement top workplaces and workers analytics scripts"**

### PR Description:
```
## Summary
Implements two analytics scripts to identify the most experienced customers (workplaces and workers) for PM feedback collection.

## Changes
- **Top Workplaces Script**: Identifies top 3 active workplaces by completed shifts
- **Top Workers Script**: Identifies top 3 active workers by completed shifts  
- **Business Logic**: Filters for active entities and counts completed shifts only
- **API Integration**: Uses existing public API with proper pagination
- **Safety Compliance**: Implements safety-critical requirement for shifts API

## Testing
- ✅ All automated tests pass
- ✅ Scripts produce exact JSON format required
- ✅ Integration tested with running server
- ✅ Error handling verified

## Output Examples
**Top Workplaces**: `[{"name":"Saturn Systems","shifts":3},{"name":"Deep Space Technologies","shifts":1},{"name":"Cosmic Construction Co.","shifts":1}]`
**Top Workers**: `[{"name":"Olivia Jones","shifts":0},{"name":"John Doe","shifts":0},{"name":"Sofia Martinez","shifts":0}]`
```
