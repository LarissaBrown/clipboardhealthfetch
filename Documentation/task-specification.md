# Task Specification: Top Workplaces & Workers Scripts

## Business Context
**PM Objective**: Solicit feedback from customers with the most experience using the platform to understand:
- What they like and don't like
- Worker quality insights
- Platform improvement opportunities

**Current State**: No analytics solution in place ‚Üí Need to pull data directly from production app as stopgap measure.

## Technical Requirements

### Script 1: Top Workplaces (`src/scripts/top-workplaces.ts`)
- **Command**: `npm run start:topWorkplaces`
- **Criteria**: "Currently active workplaces with the most shifts completed"
- **Output**: Top 3 workplaces

### Script 2: Top Workers (`src/scripts/top-workers.ts`) 
- **Command**: `npm run start:topWorkers`
- **Criteria**: "Currently active workers with the most shifts completed"
- **Output**: Top 3 workers

## Output Format Requirements

### Top Workplaces Output
```json
[
  { "name": "Martian Hydro", "shifts": 10 },
  { "name": "Luna Greens", "shifts": 7 },
  { "name": "Red Diamond Mines", "shifts": 6 }
]
```

### Top Workers Output  
```json
[
  { "name": "Dmitri David", "shifts": 10 },
  { "name": "Chike Williams", "shifts": 7 },
  { "name": "Fatima Khan", "shifts": 6 }
]
```

## Critical Constraints

### ‚úÖ Must Do
- Use existing public web API only
- Output **exactly** in specified JSON format
- Ensure scripts run successfully via npm commands
- Focus on "currently active" entities only
- Count "shifts completed" (not just created)

### ‚ùå Must NOT Do
- Modify existing APIs or add new APIs
- Include any `console.log` debug statements (causes automated test failures)
- Deviate from exact JSON output format
- Include inactive/suspended entities

### üéØ Quality Standards
- Treat as first PR at new company
- High quality, maintainable code
- Easy to review and extend
- Helpful code comments and structure

## Implementation Strategy

### Key Definitions
- **"Currently Active"**: 
  - Workplaces: `status = 0` (ACTIVE)
  - Workers: `status = 0` (ACTIVE)
- **"Shifts Completed"**: 
  - Shifts that have been claimed (`workerId IS NOT NULL`)
  - Shifts that have not been cancelled (`cancelledAt IS NULL`)
  - Shifts where `endAt` time has passed (completed)

### Data Flow
1. **Fetch Active Entities**: Get all active workplaces/workers via API
2. **Fetch Shift Data**: Get shifts associated with each entity
3. **Calculate Completed Shifts**: Count shifts meeting completion criteria
4. **Rank and Format**: Sort by shift count, take top 3, format as JSON
5. **Output**: Print exact JSON format to stdout

### API Endpoints Available
- `GET /workplaces` - List all workplaces (with pagination)
- `GET /workers` - List all workers (with pagination) 
- `GET /shifts` - List all shifts (with filtering)
- `GET /workers/claims?workerId=X` - Get worker claims

## Testing Requirements
- Automated test suite will run against output
- Must pass JSON validation
- Must execute successfully via npm scripts
- Output format must match exactly (no extra whitespace, properties, etc.)

## Success Criteria
1. ‚úÖ Both scripts execute without errors
2. ‚úÖ Output valid JSON in exact specified format
3. ‚úÖ Business logic correctly identifies "most active" entities
4. ‚úÖ Code quality suitable for production PR review
5. ‚úÖ No debug statements or extraneous output
